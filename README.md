# Jobobo

Jobobo is a job board built in Go. It's built specifically to power 
[jobs.softwareniagara.com](https://jobs.softwareniagara.com). Though someday configuration may be added 
so that it can be used by other organizations that want to provide a basic, free job board for their 
audience to use.
